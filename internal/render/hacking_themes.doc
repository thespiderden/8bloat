Themes are CSS template files with access to a single method, .Import.
Creating a theme is pretty simple:

1. Create a file under themes/. You should name this "$NAME.css"

2. Write your CSS. You can import and modify another theme by writing
{{.Import "foo"}} at the top. This will inject a CSS @import statement
with the theme's location. It's important you don't manually write
@import statements because the location of the CSS will be dynamic in
the future, and may not be at the root of the site.

3. Register your theme using registerTheme. You can see an example
of this in themes_init.go. It would be smart to create a new file
for your fork, to prevent git conflicts. Simply wrap the calls to
registration in an init function and it will be automatically ran
when the program starts up.

We don't include a way to specify themes at runtime as we consider
them code, and we use an AGPLv3 license. We want to discourage
laziness, and it's good hygiene to do proper version control, so
we expect you to release the source code in a git repository proper.

Do keep in mind that you should exercise caution when patching in
themes from other places, as they may be unsafe. Only use themes
you trust. Further, make sure the licensing is correct. We also
use text/template, so there's no sanitisation.
