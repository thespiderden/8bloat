# The asset stamp is appended to the end of static files, for example
# /static/style.css-DEADBEEF if it is set to "-DEADBEEF". This is to 
# prevent stale caches of static assets from being used after an upgrade,
# and to allow unchanged files to be cached forever by the client. Setting
# this to "snowflake" will use a Base64-encoded Snowflake ID calculated at
# startup. Each time the program starts with it set to "snowflake" the browser
# will redownload assets if 8bloat restarts, so it's strongly recommended 
# you only use the random setting for development. For backwards compatability,
# "random" is equivalent to "snowflake".

# This sets the node value for snowflake IDs, useful for high availability setups.
